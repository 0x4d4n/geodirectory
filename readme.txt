>üëâ __Flexible and powerful plugin with amazing support__
>‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
>I switched from another directory listing plugin to GeoDirectory a couple of weeks ago and I think I'm sticking with GD. I‚Äôm still moving up the learning curve but I can see that GD could be a powerful plugin for what I'm trying to do. The support has been fantastic so far. The support team is very responsive and they really try to resolve any issues. They were already helpful answering support tickets that I raised even before I bought my GD membership.

>üëâ __Great plugin, wonderful add-ons and fantastic support!!__
>‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
>Like many others I tried other plugins and even a listing theme, none gave me the options, flexibility and seamless integration with Elementor that GeoDirectory did. I worked with the free core GeoDirectory plugin for awhile (which did everything I needed it to) before I finally pulled the trigger and bought the membership giving me full access to all their add-ons and I'm so very happy I did! The add-ons will take your site to a whole new level. Support is simply the best. Fast, friendly and totally clear. You will never have to open another support ticket to explain the answer to the first üôÇ GeoDirectory is absolutely brilliant!!

>üëâ __Amazing Directory Plugin__
>‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
>This is a truly amazing directory plugin. Very solid and extremely configurable. And the most important of all, it works with all themes with minimal css changes (or no changes at all). The free support offered here is fast and acccurate. From the 4 plugins i tried, this is the only one that fulfilled my needs.
